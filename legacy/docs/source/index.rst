Synerise Cleora AI  Documentation
=====================================

**Synersie Cleora AI** is a general-purpose model for efficient, scalable learning of stable and inductive entity embeddings for heterogeneous relational data. **Cleora** embeds entities in n-dimensional spherical spaces utilizing extremely fast stable, iterative random projections, which allows for unparalleled performance and scalability.

Types of data which can be embedded include for example:

- heterogeneous undirected graphs
- heterogeneous undirected hypergraphs
- text and other categorical array data
- any combination of the above
